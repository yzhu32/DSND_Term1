    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression as the three models for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Random Forest\n",
    "Random forest model can be applied in pharmaceutical industry such as [drug sensitivity prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38231-w)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths*:\n",
    "1. Random Forest is based on the bagging algorithm and uses Ensemble Learning technique. It creates as many trees on the subset of the data and combines the output of all the trees. In this way it reduces overfitting problem in decision trees and also reduces the variance and therefore improves the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest can be used to solve both classification as well as regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random Forest works well with both categorical and continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random Forest can automatically handle missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No feature scaling required: No feature scaling (standardization and normalization) required in case of Random Forest as it uses rule based approach instead of distance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handles non-linear parameters efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Can run in parallel, which is good when the data is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Random Forest is usually robust to outliers and can handle them automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Random Forest algorithm is very stable. Even if a new data point is introduced in the dataset, the overall algorithm is not affected much since the new data may impact one tree, but it is very hard for it to impact all the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relatively high prediction time - Random Forest require much more time to train as compared to decision trees as it generates a lot of trees (instead of one tree in case of decision tree) and makes decision on the majority of votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Complexity - Random Forest creates a lot of trees (unlike only one tree in case of decision tree) and combines their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Candidacy*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest gives good performance when there are categorical variables. As there are around 45000 entries, random forest can train much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Gradient Boosting can be applied in ranking algorithms, like ranking of searches by search engines. [McRank: Learning to Rank Using Multiple Classification and Gradient Boosting](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3270-mcrank-learning-to-rank-using-multiple-classification-and-gradient-boosting.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since boosted trees are derived by optimizing an objective function, basically GBM can be used to solve almost all objective function that we can write gradient out. This including things like ranking and poission regression, which RF is harder to achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses*:\n",
    "1. Over-fitting if the data sample is too small or too noisy.\n",
    "2. Training generally takes longer because of the fact that trees are built sequentially.\n",
    "3. GBMs are harder to tune than RF. There are typically three parameters: number of trees, depth of trees and learning rate, and each tree built is generally shallow.\n",
    "4. Cannot be a parallel or distributed in principle, so when the data is very large, it will take really long time to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Candidacy*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data we have is sufficiently large and clean so gradient boosting is suitable in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is heavily used in financial industries such as [banking market analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apache-spark-for/9781785880100/ch04s09.html#:~:text=your%20free%20trial-,Applying%20logistic%20regression%20on%20bank%20marketing%20data,the%20outcome%20variable%20is%20categorical.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths*:\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression not only gives a measure of how relevant a predictor (coefficient size) is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative) - So it is a well interpretable model\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic regression is easier to implement and very efficient to train. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Weaknesses*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Main limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In the real world, the data is rarely linearly separable. Most of the time data would be a jumbled mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the number of observations are lesser than the number of features, Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise it may lead to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Candidacy*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our problem is of binary classification with clean data, all favourable conditions for logistic regression. "

For the accuracy, Gradient Boosting Classifier performs slightly better for all 3 dataset sizes compared with other two classfiers. Same goes for the case of F-score. This means that the model is able to give good results both in terms of Recall and Precision. In summary, Gradient Boosting Classifier has a very balanced trade off between prediction time v.s accuracy/F-score."

    "Let's see an example: In a factory, there are a lot of workers. Some workers are working in an assembly line and are trained to perform a specific task, they perform very well on their own tasks but overall they can't do much and are quite weak for other tasks, this type of workers are called \"weak learners\" in Boosting, still better than the person has nothing can do well. If we combine multiple workers each having different expertise/skills and make them work on their individual tasks, we end up making the final product efficiently. This is the basic idea behind boosting, here we bundle up multiple classifers and make a final model which works accurately in predicitng accross all areas of the dataset in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How you should use boosting for training and prediction for given census data*\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting works by combining multiple weak learners to create an ensemble of learners that can predict whether an individual earns above 50k or not. Each of the learners are created using features of individuals (eg. race, sex, education etc) create a set of rules that can predict a person’s income. Using this model with the census information of individuals, we can predict the same information for a potential new donor and predict if they earn more than 50K or not, and thus make a decision on the likeliness of them donating to charity.\n"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
